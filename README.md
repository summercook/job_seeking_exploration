# - Exploration of Job-Seeking Methods
## Introduction
This project was done in connection with a data science course from Udacity. The assignment was to write a blog and answer three questions. I found my own data source from Eurostat because it was relevant to my current daily life as a job-seeker. 
There are two parts. 
- Part one contains a visual exploration where many different data sets are loaded into bar charts to look for patterns between groups among 13 job-seeking methods. 
- Part two part contains a logistical regression with job-seeking status as the dependent variable. 
### Results
- There are many differences between countries, ages and over time. I found the sex differences most interesting where women are more likely to study and answer job ads and men are more likely to reach out to employers directly. 
- Of the few available demographic variables available (due to empty columns), whether or not one works in ones own country was the most was the most predictive. Sex was the least predictive.
